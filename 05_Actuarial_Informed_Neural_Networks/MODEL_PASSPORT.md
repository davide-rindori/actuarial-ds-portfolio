# Model Passport: Actuarial-Informed Neural Network (AINN)
**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Status:** Validated  
**Owner:** Dr. Davide Rindori

## 1. Model Identity
- **Model Type:** Constrained Neural-Actuarial Ensemble (Stacked LSTM + Actuarial Loss Penalties + 5-Seed Model Averaging).
- **Primary Use:** Sex-specific longevity risk assessment, SCR calculation (SST/Solvency II).
- **Target Population:** High-longevity frontier cluster (CHE, SWE, NOR, DEUTW, NLD, JPN), Male and Female separately.
- **Predecessor:** Project 04 (Unconstrained LSTM+MBC, Total only).

## 2. Architecture
- **Type:** 5-model ensemble of Stacked LSTM (48, 32 units) + Dropout(0.2) per layer.
- **Input:** 15 years of first-difference mortality factors + binary sex indicator (shape: 15 × 8).
- **Output:** 8-dimensional vector (1 common + 6 country-specific + 1 sex indicator).
- **Training:** Joint Male/Female (90 samples), batch_size=8, lr=0.001, early stopping (patience=20).
- **Optimisation:** Optuna TPE, 100 trials, 6-dimensional joint search (lookback, units, lr, λ).
- **Ensemble:** 5 independently trained models (seeds: 42, 77, 256, 512, 1024), predictions averaged in scaled space.

## 3. Constrained Loss Function
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{MSE} + 0.001 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{coherence} + 0.001 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{monotonicity}$$

- **Coherence:** penalises divergence of country-specific factors from the common trend.
- **Monotonicity (temporal):** penalises positive $\Delta K_t$ (mortality worsening over time).
- **Stationarity:** tested and excluded (hurts performance, inconsistent with data).
- **Constraint effect on RMSE:** -0.009% (neutral). Value is in governance defensibility, not accuracy.

## 4. Process Noise Calibration

### Method: Walk-Forward Residuals (No Double-Counting)
Process noise σ is calibrated on the model's one-step-ahead residuals computed via walk-forward prediction (49 predictions per sex, years 1972-2020), using `training=False` (deterministic best-estimate, no dropout).

This avoids double-counting: the historical Li-Lee σ includes variability the LSTM already captures. The residual σ isolates only the irreducible uncertainty.

| Factor | σ_historical | σ_residual | Reduction |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Kt (Male) | 5.99 | 2.80 | **53%** |
| Kt (Female) | 9.08 | 3.64 | **60%** |

**Impact:** 95% CI width reduced by ~55% across all countries. Medians unchanged — the correction affects only uncertainty quantification, not point estimates.

## 5. Governance & Validation Verdicts

### A. Predictive Performance
- **Validation RMSE (2012-2020):** 6.1725 (original scale).
- **Male RMSE:** 5.7246. **Female RMSE:** 6.5900.
- **Multi-seed CV:** 1.06% (PASS, threshold < 10%).
- **Rolling-window CV:** 5.78% (PASS, threshold < 20%).

### B. Biological Consistency
- **Gompertz Monotonicity (ages 40-90, 2050):** STRUCTURALLY COMPLIANT.
  - Isotonic regression applied post-reconstruction (ages 40-90) to enforce strict monotonicity. Data-inherited granularity artefacts from HMD corrected.
  - The observation-anchored approach applies a uniform shift ($B_x \cdot \Delta K_t$) which cannot introduce new violations.

### C. Explainability (XAI)
- **Temporal Saliency:** Distributed importance across the 15-year window (Male peak at t-3: 9.9%, Female peak at t-4: 10.2%). No pathological concentration.
- **SHAP Influence Mapping:** Netherlands and Japan are top predictors for Swiss male mortality. Distributed cross-country influence hierarchy — no single dominant predictor.

### D. Model Stability
- **Model-Based Stress Test (shock in $\Delta K_t$ domain):** STABLE.
  - Amplification ratio: 1.02× — no explosive feedback.
  - Shock absorbed smoothly; effect stabilises within the lookback window.

| West Germany | +2.245 yrs | +1.800 yrs |
| Netherlands | +2.063 yrs | +1.849 yrs |
| Japan | +1.902 yrs | +1.243 yrs |

### Reverse Stress Test (SST Compliance)

| Country | Male δ* | Female δ* |
|:---|:---|:---|

| Sweden | 22.9% | 25.5% |
| Norway | 22.8% | 25.2% |
| West Germany | 23.5% | 25.5% |
| Netherlands | 23.2% | 25.7% |
| Japan | 22.9% | 24.3% |

- **Linearity:** PASS (R² > 0.999 for all countries).
- **10% Shock:** consumes 39-44% of the SCR buffer.

## 7. Key Design Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale |
|:---|:---|
| Joint M/F training | Doubles sample size (+2.4% RMSE improvement), production-grade sex-specific output |
| Optuna 6D joint tuning | Avoids sequential tuning circularity; finds lookback-architecture interaction |
| Lookback = 15 | Captures full deceleration transition (1997-2011); +12.7% over lb=10 |
| λ = 0.001 | Governance instrument; neutral on RMSE (-0.009%); formally constrained |
| 5-seed ensemble | Credibility pooling across initialisations; reduces seed sensitivity |
| Residual-calibrated σ | Avoids double-counting; σ based on model residuals, not historical variability |
| Observation-anchored e₀ | Eliminates rank-1 reconstruction bias; anchors to HMD reality |
| Specific factors fixed at 2020 | Li-Lee stationarity assumption; prevents recursive drift |
| Isotonic Gompertz post-processing | Strict age-monotonicity (40-90) via Pool Adjacent Violators |

## 8. Known Limitations

1. **Constraint effect on RMSE is neutral (-0.009%):** constraints serve governance, not accuracy.
2. **Multi-seed CV = 9.22% (borderline):** CV = 1.06% (PASS). All 5 seeds converge between RMSE 6.17-6.33 — no outliers.
3. **Female RMSE > Male RMSE (6.59 vs 5.72):** Female mortality is intrinsically harder to predict in this cluster.
4. **Monotonicity surrogate is temporal, not age-based:** true Gompertz in loss deferred to future work.
5. **200 simulations per model:** sufficient for ensemble (5 × 200 = 1,000 total trajectories) but limits per-model tail analysis.
