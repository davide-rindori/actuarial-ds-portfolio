# Project 05: Actuarial-Informed Neural Networks
## *Constrained Deep Learning for Multi-Population Mortality Forecasting*

This project develops an alternative internal model for multi-population longevity forecasting that embeds actuarial domain knowledge directly into the neural network training process. It serves as a **challenger model** to both the Li-Lee benchmark and the unconstrained LSTM framework ([Project 04](../04_Multi_Population_Longevity_XAI)), satisfying the governance, robustness, and explainability requirements expected by regulators (FINMA/EIOPA) for internal model validation.

## Research Question
*Can physics-informed actuarial constraints embedded in the training loss improve neural mortality forecasting — particularly for near-linear populations where unconstrained LSTMs show no advantage — while preserving the model's ability to capture non-linear regime shifts?*

## Key Innovations

### 1. Constrained Loss Function (AINN)
Actuarial constraints embedded as differentiable penalties during training:
- **Coherence**: soft penalty on divergence of country-specific factors (Li-Lee assumption as regulariser).
- **Monotonicity**: temporal mortality improvement enforced during training (mortality should improve over time in developed countries).
- **Stationarity**: tested and excluded — inconsistent with data (4/6 countries violate stationarity).

### 2. Joint Male/Female Training
A single model trained on Male and Female mortality jointly, with a binary sex indicator as input feature. This doubles the effective sample size (90 training samples vs 45) and produces coherent sex-specific forecasts.

### 3. Joint Bayesian Optimisation via Optuna (6D)
Architecture (units, learning rate), temporal context (lookback window), and actuarial constraints (λ values) are optimised simultaneously in a single 100-trial joint search using Optuna's TPE sampler. This is methodologically superior to sequential tuning and reveals that the optimal constraint weight is architecture-dependent.

**Champion**: LSTM (48-32 units), lookback=15, lr=0.001, λ_coherence=0.001, λ_monotonicity=0.001.
**RMSE**: 6.1725 (overall), 5.72 (Male), 6.59 (Female). Multi-seed CV: 1.06% (PASS).
**Runtime**: 48 minutes on Apple M1 Pro.

### 4. 5-Seed Ensemble with Residual-Calibrated Process Noise
Instead of relying on a single model, 5 independently trained models (one per seed) are averaged for forecasting. Process noise σ is calibrated on the model's walk-forward residuals — not on historical Li-Lee variability — to avoid double-counting the uncertainty the LSTM already captures. This reduces 95% CI width by ~55% and produces SCR estimates in the +1.3–2.6 year range, consistent with the dual uncertainty framework.

### 5. Regulatory-Grade Robustness
- Multi-seed robustness (CV = 8.90%, PASS).
- Lookback sensitivity analysis.
- Rolling-window validation (CV = 5.78%, PASS).
- Gompertz monotonicity audit (structurally compliant).
- Temporal saliency and SHAP influence mapping.

### 6. Stress Test & SCR
- **SCR (ES 99.0%)**: +1.907 years (CHE Male), +1.516 years (CHE Female).
- **Reverse stress test**: δ* = 23.0% (CHE Male), 25.2% (CHE Female) — critical shock threshold under SST.
- **Model-based stress test**: STABLE (amplification ratio 1.02×, no explosive feedback).
