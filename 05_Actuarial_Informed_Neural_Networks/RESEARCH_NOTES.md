# Research Notes: Actuarial-Informed Neural Networks

## 1. Motivation & Context

### 1.1 From Project 04: What We Learned
- The unconstrained LSTM+MBC outperforms Li-Lee on 4/6 countries (+17.40% SWE, +12.57% DEUTW, +4.43% NLD, +3.52% NOR).
- It marginally underperforms on Switzerland (-2.08%) and Japan (-1.31%) — the two most linear populations in the cluster.
- The ablation studies showed that First Differences (+48.6%) and MBC (+18.6%) are the two critical design choices.
- MC Dropout contributes ~1% of total uncertainty; process noise dominates (~99%).
- The model passes all biological consistency tests (Gompertz monotonicity) but only post-hoc — it is not structurally guaranteed.

### 1.2 The Gap This Project Fills
- **Structural guarantees**: Can we embed biological and actuarial constraints *during training* rather than verifying them after the fact?
- **Near-linear populations**: Can constrained training improve performance on CHE and JPN where the unconstrained model slightly loses?
- **Regulatory preference**: Regulators prefer models with built-in safeguards over models that happen to pass audits. A constrained architecture is inherently more defensible for internal model validation (FINMA/EIOPA).
- **Sex-specific modelling**: Project 04 uses both-sexes-combined data. L&H products (annuities, pension buy-outs, longevity swaps) require M/F separation. This project addresses that gap.

### 1.3 Connection to Wüthrich's Research Agenda
- Wüthrich's "actuarial learning" framework advocates for combining statistical learning with actuarial structure.
- The AINN approach is the natural multi-population extension of this philosophy.
- The credibility-weighted blending (Notebook 04) directly connects to credibility theory — a core actuarial concept.
- The formalisation of MBC as Bayesian shrinkage speaks the language of regularised statistical estimation.

## 2. Data & Preprocessing (Notebook 01)

### 2.1 Design Decisions
- **Same cluster as Project 04**: CHE, SWE, NOR, DEUTW, NLD, JPN (1956-2020, ages 0-90). This ensures direct comparability of results.
- **Sex-specific**: Unlike Project 04 (Total only), we load Female, Male, and Total columns from HMD. This doubles the modelling pipeline but enables production-grade applicability.
- **Same epsilon** ($10^{-10}$) for log-stability, same age cap at 90, same time window truncation rationale (DEUTW availability).

### 2.2 Notation Consistency with Project 04
We maintain identical notation throughout:
- $m_{x,t}$: Central death rate at age $x$, year $t$.
- $\ln(m_{x,t})$: Log-mortality (input to SVD).
- $a_x$: Mean log-mortality over time (age profile / biological baseline).
- $b_x$: Age sensitivity (first left singular vector, normalised: $\sum_x b_x = 1$).
- $k_t$: Mortality index / time trend (first right singular vector, scaled).
- $B_x$, $K_t$: Li-Lee Common Factor components.
- $b_{x,i}$, $k_{t,i}$: Country-specific components.
- $\Delta K_t$, $\Delta k_{t,i}$: First differences (annual changes).

The only extension is the sex subscript $s \in \{M, F\}$, which we add where needed: $m_{x,t,i,s}$, $K_t^{(s)}$, $k_{t,i}^{(s)}$.

### 2.3 Results: Data Validation
- All 6 countries loaded successfully: 65 years × 91 ages = 5,915 rows each.
- Zero NaN values after cleaning (epsilon applied to rare zero-death cells).
- Matrix dimensions: (91, 65) for each country × sex combination.
- Log-mortality range (CHE Male): [-23.03, -1.10] — consistent with Project 04.

## 3. Actuarial Benchmarking: Li-Lee Sex-Specific (Notebook 02)

### 3.1 Methodology
The implementation follows exactly the same procedure as Project 04 (Notebook 02), applied independently to Male and Female:
1. Lee-Carter independent fit via SVD for each country × sex.
2. Li-Lee Common Factor from the cluster average matrix (per sex).
3. Country-Specific Factors from the residual after removing the common component.
4. Stationarity tests (ADF + KPSS) on specific factors.
5. First Differences for AINN input.

### 3.2 Results: Common Factor $K_t$

| Sex | $K_t$ Range | Observation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Male | [-73.04, +51.75] | Steeper decline, especially post-1970 |
| Female | [-69.78, +61.71] | Shallower decline, higher starting point |

**Interpretation**: The male common trend declines more steeply than the female one. This is consistent with the well-documented "male mortality convergence" phenomenon: male mortality improved faster than female mortality over the second half of the 20th century, driven primarily by reductions in cardiovascular disease and smoking-related deaths. The gap between M and F common trends narrows post-2000, consistent with the literature on the closing of the sex-mortality differential.

**Comparison with Project 04**: Project 04 reported a single $K_t$ (Total) ranging approximately [-60, +50]. The sex-specific decomposition reveals that the "Total" trend is a weighted average of a steeper male decline and a shallower female decline — as expected.

### 3.3 Results: Country-Specific Factors $k_{t,i}$

**Male:**
| Country | $k_{t,i}$ Range | Pattern |
|:---|:---|:---|
| CHE | [-4.21, +2.44] | Stable, near zero |
| SWE | [-0.18, +0.02] | Extremely stable |
| NOR | [-31.53, +7.09] | Highly volatile |
| DEUTW | [-1.21, +3.80] | Moderate, stable |
| NLD | [-14.12, +17.01] | Volatile |
| JPN | [-14.05, +31.23] | Large initial trend (catch-up) |

**Female:**
| Country | $k_{t,i}$ Range | Pattern |
|:---|:---|:---|
| CHE | [-7.37, +2.54] | Slightly more volatile than Male |
| SWE | [-7.26, +1.66] | More volatile than Male (unexpected) |
| NOR | [-27.82, +8.89] | Volatile (less than Male) |
| DEUTW | [-1.54, +1.89] | Stable |
| NLD | [-16.14, +24.78] | Volatile |
| JPN | [-17.65, +44.97] | Largest range in cluster |

**Key observations:**
1. **Japan's catch-up is more pronounced for females** (range 62.6 vs 45.3 for males). This reflects the extraordinary gains in female life expectancy in Japan from the 1960s onwards — Japan went from below-average female mortality to the world's highest female life expectancy.
2. **Sweden is more volatile for females than males** (range 8.9 vs 0.2). This is unexpected and warrants investigation. One hypothesis: Swedish female mortality improvements decelerated earlier than male ones, creating a specific-factor drift that the common trend does not capture.
3. **Norway remains the most volatile** for both sexes, consistent with Project 04's finding that small populations exhibit higher variance in rank-1 SVD models.
4. **Switzerland and West Germany remain stable** for both sexes — these are the "core" populations where the common trend captures most of the signal.

**Comparison with Project 04**: The patterns are qualitatively identical to Project 04 (Total). Japan's catch-up, Norway's volatility, and European stability are all reproduced. The sex split reveals additional structure (Sweden Female, Japan Female) that was masked in the combined data.

### 3.4 Stationarity Analysis

#### Results: Male

| Country | ADF p-value | ADF | KPSS p-value | KPSS | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Switzerland** | 0.0002 | **PASS** | 0.1000 | **PASS** | **Stationary** |
| **Sweden** | 0.0000 | **PASS** | 0.1000 | **PASS** | **Stationary** |
| **Norway** | 0.0013 | **PASS** | 0.0288 | **FAIL** | Conflict |
| **West Germany** | 0.9987 | **FAIL** | 0.0100 | **FAIL** | **Unit Root** |
| **Netherlands** | 0.9158 | **FAIL** | 0.0100 | **FAIL** | **Unit Root** |
| **Japan** | 0.1704 | **FAIL** | 0.0654 | **PASS** | Conflict |

#### Results: Female

| Country | ADF p-value | ADF | KPSS p-value | KPSS | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Switzerland** | 0.9587 | **FAIL** | 0.1000 | **PASS** | Conflict |
| **Sweden** | 0.0007 | **PASS** | 0.1000 | **PASS** | **Stationary** |
| **Norway** | 0.0576 | **FAIL** | 0.0581 | **PASS** | Conflict |
| **West Germany** | 0.8411 | **FAIL** | 0.0100 | **FAIL** | **Unit Root** |
| **Netherlands** | 0.8369 | **FAIL** | 0.0100 | **FAIL** | **Unit Root** |
| **Japan** | 0.0221 | **PASS** | 0.0100 | **FAIL** | Conflict |

#### Comparison with Project 04 (Total, both sexes combined)

| Country | Project 04 (Total) | Project 05 (Male) | Project 05 (Female) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Switzerland** | Conflict (ADF FAIL, KPSS PASS) | **Stationary** | Conflict |
| **Sweden** | Unit Root (ADF FAIL, KPSS FAIL) | **Stationary** | **Stationary** |
| **Norway** | Stationary (ADF PASS, KPSS PASS) | Conflict | Conflict |
| **West Germany** | Unit Root | **Unit Root** | **Unit Root** |
| **Netherlands** | Unit Root | **Unit Root** | **Unit Root** |
| **Japan** | Conflict (ADF PASS, KPSS FAIL) | Conflict | Conflict |

#### Discussion

This is a significant finding. The sex-specific decomposition reveals a **fundamentally different stationarity landscape** compared to Project 04:

1. **Switzerland Male is stationary** (both tests agree, p < 0.001). In Project 04 (Total), Switzerland was in the "Conflict" zone. This suggests that the non-stationarity in the combined data was driven primarily by the female component. For the AINN, this means the coherence penalty is *appropriate* for Swiss males but may fight the data for Swiss females.

2. **Sweden Male is stationary** (ADF p = 0.0000). In Project 04, Sweden was classified as "Unit Root" — the strongest non-stationarity verdict in the cluster. The sex split reveals that this was driven entirely by the female component (or by the aggregation artefact of combining two differently-behaved series). Swedish males revert to the common trend; Swedish females do not diverge either (also stationary). This contradicts the Project 04 finding and suggests that the "both sexes combined" aggregation introduced a spurious unit root.

3. **Norway flips from Stationary to Conflict.** In Project 04, Norway was the cleanest stationary case. With sex-specific data, both Male and Female show conflict (ADF and KPSS disagree). The high volatility of Norwegian specific factors (small population effect) makes the tests less decisive when applied to sex-specific subsamples with even smaller effective sample sizes.

4. **West Germany and Netherlands remain Unit Root** for both sexes. This is the most robust finding — consistent across Project 04 and both sexes here. These countries have persistent structural drifts that no aggregation can mask.

5. **Japan remains in the Conflict zone** for both sexes, consistent with Project 04. The "Trend-Stationary" interpretation holds: Japan's mean is drifting away from the cluster, but with enough momentum to occasionally fool the ADF test.

#### Implications for the AINN

- The coherence penalty ($\mathcal{L}_{coherence}$) should be **sex-specific in its expected effect**: it is well-justified for Male (where 2/6 countries are genuinely stationary) but more controversial for Female (where only 1/6 is clearly stationary).
- The λ sweep should be run independently for Male and Female to identify potentially different optimal configurations.
- The finding that sex-specific decomposition changes the stationarity landscape is itself a publishable observation — it demonstrates that "both sexes combined" analysis can mask important structural differences.

### 3.5 First Differences and Feature Matrix
- Feature matrix shape: (64, 7) for each sex — 64 annual changes (from 65 years), 7 columns (1 common + 6 specific).
- This is the direct input for the AINN sliding-window training, identical in structure to Project 04.
- All parameters persisted to `li_lee_params.pkl` for downstream use.

## 4. AINN Training: Design, Results, and Analysis (Notebook 03)

### 4.1 Architectural Decision: Joint Male/Female Training

#### The Problem
The initial approach — training separate models for Male and Female — produced severe overfitting. With only 45 training samples per sex (10-year lookback on 55 training differences), the model memorised the training set without generalising. Validation MSE was 28x higher than training MSE, and the model converged to near-constant predictions.

#### The Solution
We concatenated Male and Female sequences into a single training set, adding a binary sex indicator (0=Male, 1=Female) as the 8th input feature. This:
- Doubles the effective sample size from 45 to 90 training samples.
- Allows the model to learn shared temporal structure (post-2011 deceleration, convergence dynamics) across sexes.
- Preserves sex-specific output through the indicator feature.
- Is analogous to how Li-Lee uses a Common Factor across countries — here we use "common learning" across sexes.

#### Result
Joint training reduced RMSE from 7.77 (separate) to 7.59 (joint) — a **+2.39% improvement**. The validation loss dropped from ~29.5 to ~4.9, indicating genuine generalisation rather than memorisation.

#### Discussion
This is the single most impactful design choice in the notebook. It is also a genuine innovation over Project 04, which uses only "Total" (both sexes combined). The joint M/F approach is more realistic for L&H applications: a single model that produces coherent M/F projections, learning from the shared biological signal while respecting sex-specific dynamics.

The approach is defensible from multiple angles:
- **Statistical**: more data → better generalisation (fundamental ML principle).
- **Actuarial**: M and F mortality share the same underlying drivers (medical advances, lifestyle changes) with different intensities — a joint model captures this.
- **Practical**: one model to maintain instead of two, with guaranteed coherence between M/F projections.

### 4.2 Architecture: Fixed by Design

We use the same stacked LSTM (32-16 units, 20% dropout) as Project 04's champion. This is a deliberate methodological choice, not a limitation:
- **Isolation of variables**: the only difference between Project 04 and Project 05 is the constrained loss and the joint M/F training. If we also changed the architecture, we could not attribute improvements to the constraints.
- **Consistency with Bayesian tuning**: Project 04's tuner identified 32-16 as optimal for this dataset size. The dataset size is similar (90 vs 45 samples, same feature dimensionality).
- **Regulatory defensibility**: a fixed architecture with documented rationale is easier to validate than one that was re-tuned.

The output layer has 8 units (7 mortality factors + 1 sex indicator reconstruction). The sex indicator in the output is not penalised by any constraint — it serves only as a reconstruction target for the autoencoder-like structure.

### 4.3 Constrained Loss Function: Implementation

#### Final Formulation
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{MSE} + \lambda_1 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{coherence} + \lambda_2 \cdot \mathcal{L}_{monotonicity}$$

#### Coherence Penalty ($\lambda_1$)
- **Implementation**: $\mathcal{L}_{coherence} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{6} (\hat{\Delta k}_{t,i})^2$
- Penalises the squared magnitude of predicted country-specific variations (columns 1-6 of the output).
- A large $|\Delta k_{t,i}|$ means the country is diverging from the common trend — the penalty discourages this.
- **Note**: We penalise the scaled (standardised) predictions, not the original-scale values. This means the penalty operates on a normalised space where all factors have comparable magnitude.

#### Monotonicity Surrogate ($\lambda_2$)
- **Implementation**: $\mathcal{L}_{monotonicity} = \text{mean}(\text{ReLU}(\hat{\Delta K}_t)^2)$
- Penalises positive predictions of the common factor variation (column 0).
- **Rationale**: $K_t$ decreasing = mortality improving (longevity increasing). $\Delta K_t > 0$ means mortality is worsening, which is biologically implausible as a long-term trend for developed countries.
- **Why "surrogate"**: The original ROADMAP proposed penalising $m_{x+1} < m_x$ (age-monotonicity) directly. This requires back-transforming $\Delta K_t$ into death rates within the training loop — computationally expensive and numerically fragile. The temporal monotonicity surrogate (mortality should improve over time) is simpler, differentiable, and captures the same actuarial intuition at the aggregate level.
- **Limitation**: This does not enforce age-monotonicity (Gompertz). That will be verified post-hoc in the validation notebook, as in Project 04.

#### Stationarity Penalty ($\lambda_3$) — Tested and Excluded
- **Implementation**: $\mathcal{L}_{stationarity} = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{i=1}^{6} |\hat{\Delta k}_{t,i}|$
- Penalises the absolute magnitude of specific factor predictions (L1 norm, encouraging sparsity/mean-reversion).
- **Test results**: At $\lambda_3 = 0.1$, RMSE = 7.584 (vs 7.582 without). At $\lambda_3 = 1.0$, RMSE = 7.587 (worse).
- **Decision**: Excluded from the champion model. The penalty does not improve performance and is inconsistent with the data — our stationarity analysis (Section 3.4) showed that 4/6 countries have non-stationary specific factors. Forcing stationarity fights the data.
- **Documentation value**: Testing and excluding with evidence is stronger than simply not including it. A reviewer cannot object that we "forgot" stationarity.

### 4.4 Preliminary Lambda Sweep (Fixed Architecture)

Before the joint Bayesian Optimisation, we ran a preliminary λ sweep with a fixed architecture (32-16 units, lr=0.001) to understand the constraint landscape. This served as an exploratory step to identify the relevant range of λ values.

#### Results (Fixed Architecture, Joint M/F, 90 samples)

| Configuration | $\lambda_1$ (coh) | $\lambda_2$ (mono) | RMSE | Mean |Specific| | Frac(dKt>0) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Mono=1.0 | 0.0 | 1.0 | **7.5817** | 0.088 | 50.0% |
| Both=1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | 7.5818 | 0.074 | 50.0% |
| Mono=0.1 | 0.0 | 0.1 | 7.5838 | 0.089 | 50.0% |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| Unconstrained | 0.0 | 0.0 | 7.5851 | 0.101 | 55.6% |

Key observations from the preliminary sweep:
- The improvement from constraints was marginal (+0.045%) but consistent.
- The monotonicity penalty was more effective than coherence.
- Constraints had a meaningful effect on model properties (specific factors −27%, frac(dKt>0) −10%).
- The stationarity penalty hurt performance at λ≥1.0 and was excluded.

This preliminary exploration informed the design of the joint Bayesian Optimisation — specifically, confirming that λ values in {0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0} cover the relevant range.

### 4.5 Exploratory Phase: Keras Tuner (5D, lb=10 Fixed)

As an intermediate step between the preliminary λ sweep and the final joint optimisation, we ran a 5-dimensional Bayesian Optimisation using Keras Tuner with lookback fixed at 10 (the value used in Project 04). This served as a proof-of-concept that joint architecture + constraint tuning is feasible and beneficial.

#### Champion Found (Keras Tuner, lb=10)

| Parameter | Value |
|:---|:---|
| units_l1 | 64 |
| units_l2 | 8 |
| learning_rate | 0.01 |
| λ_coherence | 0.001 |
| λ_monotonicity | 0.001 |
| RMSE | 7.0687 |
| Multi-seed CV | 1.23% |

Key observations:
- The tuner found a **64→8 bottleneck architecture** (not the balanced 32→16 of Project 04).
- Learning rate 0.01 (10× higher than Project 04's 0.001) — consistent with the larger first layer.
- Optimal λ = 0.001 (not 1.0 as suggested by the preliminary sweep) — confirming the architecture-constraint interaction.

However, this run fixed lb=10 by necessity (Keras Tuner cannot handle variable input shape). Lookback sensitivity analysis showed lb=15 was superior (+5.94%), motivating the final joint optimisation with Optuna.

### 4.6 Final Optimisation: Optuna 6D Joint Tuning

#### Why Optuna Instead of Keras Tuner

Keras Tuner's architecture requires all inputs to have the same shape across trials, making it impossible to tune the lookback window jointly with other parameters. Optuna is framework-agnostic: the objective function is a plain Python function that the user writes, so any parameter — including lookback, which changes the data preparation step — can be tuned freely.

This is the crucial methodological advantage: Optuna allows a truly joint 6-dimensional search, avoiding the circularity problem of sequential tuning (tune arch, find best lb, re-tune arch with new lb, find different best lb, etc.).

#### Hyperparameter Space

| Parameter | Values | Rationale |
|:---|:---|:---|
| lookback | {5, 7, 10, 12, 15} | Temporal context window |
| units_l1 | {16, 32, 48, 64} | First LSTM layer capacity |
| units_l2 | {8, 16, 24, 32} | Second LSTM layer capacity |
| learning_rate | {0.01, 0.005, 0.001, 0.0005, 0.0001} | Optimiser step size |
| $\lambda_{coherence}$ | {0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0} | Li-Lee coherence constraint weight |
| $\lambda_{monotonicity}$ | {0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0} | Temporal monotonicity constraint weight |

Total space: 5 × 4 × 4 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 10,000 combinations. Optuna's TPE (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) sampler explores this space in 100 trials, building a probabilistic model of the objective function and directing sampling toward promising regions. TPE is empirically superior to random search and grid search on this type of categorical-heavy space.

**Fixed parameters** (not tuned, with rationale):
- **Dropout = 0.2**: Required for MC Dropout inference (Bayesian uncertainty quantification in Notebook 04). This is an architectural constraint, not an optimisation target.
- **Batch size = 8**: Same as Project 04. With 80-100 training samples (depending on lookback), batch_size=8 gives 10-12 batches per epoch — sufficient gradient signal.
- **Training: joint M/F**: Validated by ablation (+2.4% over separate training).

**Runtime**: 48 minutes for 100 trials on Apple M1 Pro (≈29 seconds per trial on average). This is an investment made once for model selection — downstream notebooks load the saved model and never re-run this cell.

#### Champion Configuration Found

| Parameter | Value |
|:---|:---|
| lookback | **15** |
| units_l1 | **48** |
| units_l2 | **32** |
| learning_rate | **0.001** |
| $\lambda_{coherence}$ | **0.001** |
| $\lambda_{monotonicity}$ | **0.001** |
| RMSE | **6.1725** |

### 4.7 Champion Architecture Analysis (Optuna)

#### Lookback = 15: The Most Important Finding

All top 5 Optuna trials converge on lookback=15. This is a strong, unambiguous signal. The TPE sampler allocated the majority of trials to lb=15 after the first promising results appeared there, confirming its superiority.

Why is lb=15 better than lb=10?

The mortality deceleration of the 2010s is the key signal the model needs to learn. With lb=10, the training window (1966-2011 differences) includes this deceleration only in the most recent samples. With lb=15, the model processes sequences ending at 2011 that *start* at 1997, giving it 15 years of context to understand the transition from fast improvement (1990s) to deceleration (2000s-2010s). The structural shift is better represented in the input.

This is consistent with Project 04's finding that lb=15 produced marginally lower RMSE — but in Project 04, the improvement was small enough to be dismissed (lb=15 sacrificed too many training samples on a smaller dataset). With joint M/F training (80 samples with lb=15 vs 90 with lb=10), the trade-off is more favourable.

**Comparison with Project 04 decision**: Project 04 chose lb=10 over lb=15 for "data parsimony" — lb=15 reduced training samples from 45 to 40 (−11%). Here, lb=15 reduces samples from 90 to 80 (−11% also), but the absolute number of samples (80 vs 40) makes a larger difference in model capacity.

#### Architecture: 48→32 (Balanced) vs 64→8 (Bottleneck)

With lb=15, Optuna finds a **balanced** architecture (48→32) rather than the bottleneck (64→8) found by Keras Tuner with lb=10. This is an important observation:

- With lb=10, the bottleneck 64→8 was optimal because the model needed aggressive compression to avoid memorising the short, noisy input sequences.
- With lb=15, the input sequences are longer and richer (15 years of history instead of 10). The model can maintain a wider representation in the second layer (32 instead of 8) because there is more genuine signal to represent.

This confirms that architecture and lookback interact: the optimal compression depends on how much signal is in the input. This is a finding worth discussing in the paper — it suggests that the common practice of tuning architecture independently of the temporal window is methodologically suboptimal.

#### Learning Rate: 0.001 (Conservative)

With lb=15 and architecture 48→32, the optimal learning rate drops back to 0.001 (same as Project 04). This makes sense: the model has more training samples (80 vs 90 with lb=10) and longer sequences, so it needs more careful, slower gradient descent to converge without overshooting. The 64-8 architecture with lb=10 needed lr=0.01 because it was making bold predictions from short sequences; the 48-32 architecture with lb=15 learns more gradually from richer context.

#### Training Convergence

The champion model trains for 106 epochs (best at epoch 86, patience=20). This is notably longer than the Keras Tuner champion (33 epochs, best at 13) — consistent with the lower learning rate. The training curves show both train and validation loss converging smoothly and together, without the dramatic gap seen in earlier experiments. This is the best training behaviour we have observed across all configurations.

### 4.8 Champion Performance

| Metric | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Overall RMSE (original scale) | **6.1725** |
| Male RMSE | 5.7246 |
| Female RMSE | 6.5900 |
| Mean \|specific factor\| | 0.8942 |
| Frac(dKt>0) | 55.6% |
| Best epoch | 86 |
| Training stopped at | epoch 106 |

**Comparison with Keras Tuner champion (lb=10):**

| Metric | KT champion (lb=10) | Optuna champion (lb=15) | Δ |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Overall RMSE | 7.0687 | 6.1725 | **+12.7%** |
| Male RMSE | 6.6525 | 5.7246 | +13.9% |
| Female RMSE | 7.4618 | 6.5900 | +11.7% |
| Mean \|specific\| | 0.4980 | 0.8942 | Higher (more expressive) |
| Frac(dKt>0) | 61.1% | 55.6% | Lower (better monotonicity) |

The improvement is substantial and consistent across both sexes. The higher mean \|specific factor\| suggests the Optuna champion is more expressive — it allows country-specific factors to vary more freely. This is a consequence of lb=15 providing enough context to distinguish genuine country-specific dynamics from noise.

### 4.9 Constraint Analysis (Optuna Champion)

#### Constraint Effect: -0.009%

The unconstrained version of the champion (same architecture, lb=15, λ=0) produces RMSE = 6.1720. The constrained champion produces 6.1725. The constraints **very marginally hurt** RMSE (-0.009%) — an inconsequential difference.

This is an **unexpected finding** that requires careful interpretation:

**Why do constraints slightly hurt?** With lb=15 and a 48→32 architecture, the model has sufficient capacity and temporal context to generalise well on its own. The λ=0.001 constraints impose a tiny but non-zero penalty, adding a small bias that in this case slightly increases RMSE. The effect is smaller than the seed-to-seed variance (CV=8.9%), so it is not statistically meaningful.

**What does this mean for the actuarial constraints story?** The constraints serve primarily as a governance instrument — a formal statement that the model has been designed to respect actuarial principles. The numerical impact is negligible in either direction. In the paper, we can honestly report: "The constrained model performs equivalently to the unconstrained model on one-step-ahead RMSE. The value of the constraints lies in the regulatory defensibility of the model design, and in their potential to improve long-term forecasting stability — which will be assessed in Notebook 04."

This is a scientifically honest result: we do not overstate the impact of the constraints. A model that honestly reports null RMSE effects with justified theoretical motivation is more credible than one that overstates marginal improvements.

#### Stationarity Penalty: Excluded with Evidence

| Configuration | RMSE | vs Champion |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Champion (no stat) | 6.1725 | — |
| + Stat=0.01 | 6.1809 | +0.014% worse |
| + Stat=0.1 | 6.2244 | +0.8% worse |
| + Stat=1.0 | 6.6602 | +7.9% worse |

The stationarity penalty consistently hurts performance, with damage increasing with λ. This is expected: forcing mean-reversion on time series that are empirically non-stationary (4/6 countries show unit roots) fights the data. The exclusion is documented with evidence across all λ levels.

### 4.10 Multi-Seed Robustness (Optuna Champion)

| Seed | RMSE |
|:---|:---|
| 42 | 6.1725 |
| 123 | 7.6080 |
| 256 | 6.4643 |
| 512 | 6.2157 |
| 1024 | 6.4866 |

- **Mean**: 6.5895
- **Std**: 0.5868
- **CV**: 8.90%
- **Verdict**: PASS (threshold: CV < 10%)

**Critical observation**: CV = 8.90% is much higher than the Keras Tuner champion (1.23%). In particular, Seed 123 produces RMSE = 7.61 — nearly as bad as the pre-tuning baseline. This is a flag that deserves honest discussion.

**Why is the Optuna champion less stable?**

The 48→32 architecture with lb=15 and lr=0.001 is a more complex model than the 64→8 with lb=10 and lr=0.01. It trains for 106 epochs (vs 33 for the KT champion), meaning it has more opportunity to land in different local minima depending on the random initialisation. The slow learning rate makes the optimisation path more sensitive to the starting point.

The Seed 123 outlier (RMSE 7.61) is likely a case where the model converged to a local minimum that does not generalise well. This is a known issue with LSTM training on small datasets: multiple local optima exist, and not all gradient descent paths lead to the global one.

**Implications for deployment**: In practice, we use seed 42 (the reference seed). The model is trained once with this seed, saved, and reloaded for inference. The multi-seed analysis is a "worst-case" robustness check, not a description of how the model will be used. A CV of 8.90% that technically passes the threshold while containing one outlier seed is acceptable for research, but borderline for production deployment.

**Mitigation**: Downstream notebooks should always load the saved model (seed 42) rather than retraining. If the rolling-window validation (Notebook 05) reveals instability, we can consider ensemble averaging across multiple seeds as a robustness measure.

**Comparison with Project 04**: Project 04 did not perform multi-seed analysis. This project provides it, which is a methodological improvement regardless of the CV value.

### 4.11 Complete Ablation Summary

| Design Choice | RMSE | vs Champion |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Separate M/F, fixed arch 32-16, lb=10 | 7.7705 | −25.9% |
| Joint M/F, fixed arch 32-16, lb=10, unconstrained | 7.5851 | −22.9% |
| Joint M/F, fixed arch 32-16, lb=10, constrained | 7.5817 | −22.8% |
| Joint M/F, Keras Tuner (5D, lb=10) | 7.0687 | −14.5% |
| Joint M/F, Optuna (6D), unconstrained | 6.1720 | +0.01% better |
| **Joint M/F, Optuna (6D), CHAMPION** | **6.1725** | **— best** |

**Hierarchy of impact**:
1. **Lookback optimisation** (lb=10 → lb=15): 7.07 → 6.17 — **+12.7%** (most impactful individual factor after joining)
2. **Architecture tuning** (fixed 32-16 → tuned 64-8 → 48-32): 7.59 → 7.07 → 6.17 — **+18.5% total**
3. **Joint M/F training**: 7.77 → 7.59 — **+2.4%**
4. **Actuarial constraints**: effectively neutral on RMSE (governance value)

**The most important insight**: the improvement from lookback tuning (+12.7%) is larger than the improvement from architecture tuning (+6.5%). This suggests that in mortality modelling, *temporal context* (how much history the model sees) is more important than *model capacity* (how large the network is). This makes actuarial sense: mortality trends are driven by slow-moving structural factors (healthcare improvements, lifestyle changes) that require long historical observation to characterise.

### 4.12 Champion Configuration (Final, Optuna)

| Parameter | Value |
|:---|:---|
| Architecture | LSTM (48, 32 units) + Dropout(0.2) each layer |
| Training | Joint M/F, lookback=15, batch=8, lr=0.001 |
| Loss | MSE + Coherence (λ=0.001) + Monotonicity (λ=0.001) |
| Early stopping | patience=20, best at epoch 86 |
| Validation RMSE | 6.1725 (overall), 5.72 (Male), 6.59 (Female) |
| Multi-seed CV | 8.90% (PASS, borderline) |
| Constraint effect | −0.009% (neutral) |
| Optimisation | Optuna TPE, 100 trials, 6D joint |
| Runtime | 48 minutes |

### 4.13 Limitations and Open Points (Post-Optuna)

1. **Multi-seed CV = 8.90% is borderline.** Seed 123 is an outlier (RMSE 7.61 vs mean 6.59). In deployment, we use seed 42 exclusively (the reference seed). The rolling-window validation (Notebook 05) will provide a more robust estimate of out-of-sample performance.

2. **Constraint effect is neutral on RMSE (-0.009%).** The value of constraints lies in governance defensibility and potential long-term stability — not in one-step-ahead accuracy. This must be demonstrated in Notebook 04.

3. **Female RMSE > Male RMSE (6.59 vs 5.72).** The asymmetry reduced compared to the KT champion (7.46 vs 6.65), but remains. Female mortality is intrinsically harder to predict in our cluster, consistent with the higher volatility of female-specific factors.

4. **frac(dKt>0) = 55.6% with λ_mono=0.001.** The monotonicity constraint has limited effect at this λ value. If long-term forecasting in Notebook 04 reveals systematic upward drift, increasing λ_mono should be considered.

5. **Optuna uses 100 trials on 10,000 possible combinations (1% coverage).** With TPE, this is efficient but not exhaustive. A different random seed for the sampler (seed=42 is used throughout) might find a slightly different champion. This is acceptable for research purposes.

6. **The sex indicator is binary.** A richer encoding (sex-specific embeddings or separate output heads) could improve performance, particularly for Female. This is left as future work.

7. **Lookback = 15 reduces training samples to 80** (from 90 with lb=10). This is a material reduction on an already small dataset. The rolling-window validation will test whether the model generalises across different historical periods.

## 5. MBC as Bayesian Shrinkage (Theoretical Contribution)

### 5.1 The Observation
MBC adds a constant bias $\mathcal{B}$ to each predicted variation:
$$Level_t = Level_{t-1} + (\Delta_{LSTM} + \mathcal{B})$$

This is equivalent to shrinking the neural prediction toward the Li-Lee drift:
$$\hat{\Delta}_t^{MBC} = \hat{\Delta}_t^{LSTM} + \underbrace{(\mu_{Li-Lee} - \mu_{LSTM})}_{\mathcal{B}}$$

### 5.2 Credibility Theory Interpretation
- Let $Z$ be the credibility weight assigned to the LSTM prediction.
- The blended forecast is: $\hat{\Delta}_t = Z \cdot \hat{\Delta}_t^{LSTM} + (1-Z) \cdot \mu_{Li-Lee}$
- MBC corresponds to $Z = 1$ with an additive correction — full credibility to the neural signal, but anchored to the actuarial prior.
- A generalised version would tune $Z \in [0, 1]$ based on out-of-sample performance.

### 5.3 Bayesian Shrinkage Framing
- The Li-Lee drift $\mu_{Li-Lee}$ acts as the prior mean.
- The LSTM prediction is the likelihood.
- MBC is a point estimate under a specific prior-likelihood weighting.
- This connects directly to Wüthrich's framework of "actuarial learning" as regularised statistical estimation.

## 7. True Model-Based Stress Test (Planned: Notebook 06)

### 7.1 Concept
Instead of applying a post-hoc level-shift to $e_0$, translate a mortality shock into the $\Delta K_t$ domain:
1. Define shock: $m_x^{shocked} = (1 - \delta) \cdot m_x$ for all ages.
2. Compute the implied $\Delta K_t^{shock}$ via inverse Li-Lee mapping.
3. Inject $\Delta K_t^{shock}$ into the sliding window at the shock year (e.g., 2026).
4. Re-execute the recursive forecast with MC Dropout.

### 7.2 Expected Behaviour
- The shock appears as a single anomalous $\Delta K_t$ in the 10-year window.
- After ~10 years, the shock exits the window and the model "forgets" it.
- The result should converge to the deterministic level-shift, with a transient dampening/amplification effect.

### 7.3 Regulatory Value
- Demonstrates model stability (no explosive amplification).
- Quantifies the transient response function.
- Shows whether the LSTM introduces non-linear feedback effects.
- Directly addresses FINMA/EIOPA model validation requirements.

## 8. Open Questions & Risks

1. **Multi-seed CV = 8.90% is borderline.** Seed 123 produces RMSE 7.61, significantly worse than the mean (6.59). In deployment we use seed 42. The rolling-window validation (Notebook 05) will reveal whether this instability extends to different historical periods.
2. **Constraint effect is neutral (-0.009% RMSE).** The value of constraints must be demonstrated through long-term forecasting stability (Notebook 04), not one-step-ahead accuracy.
3. **The lookback-architecture interaction is confirmed but not fully characterised.** With lb=15, the optimal architecture is 48→32 (balanced). With lb=10, it was 64→8 (bottleneck). A systematic study of this interaction would require more trial budget.
4. **Female mortality is harder to predict.** RMSE for Female (6.59) is consistently higher than Male (5.72). Sex-specific regularisation could help but adds complexity.
5. **Dropout fixed at 0.2.** This is required for MC Dropout inference. If a different dropout rate would improve performance, it would require redesigning the uncertainty quantification approach.

---

## 9. Limitations (Current State)

- **No CBD benchmark**: Unlike Project 04, we have not implemented the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model for ages 65-90. This is a deliberate scope reduction — the AINN's contribution is in the constrained loss and joint optimisation, not in additional actuarial baselines.
- **No exposure data**: We work with death rates ($m_x$) only. This is sufficient for the Li-Lee framework.
- **Monotonicity surrogate is temporal, not age-based**: We penalise $\Delta K_t > 0$ (mortality worsening over time) but do not enforce $m_{x+1} \geq m_x$ during training. Age-monotonicity is verified post-hoc in Notebook 04.
- **Constraint effect is neutral on RMSE**: The primary value of constraints lies in governance defensibility and potential long-term forecasting stability. Whether this materialises will be tested in Notebook 04.
- **Multi-seed CV = 8.90% is borderline**: Seed 123 is an outlier. The rolling-window validation (Notebook 05) will provide a more robust robustness estimate.
- **Optuna explores only 1% of the 10,000-combination space**: 100 trials with TPE is efficient but not exhaustive. The champion found is likely near-optimal but not provably optimal.

## 10. Stochastic Forecasting & Life Expectancy (Notebook 04)

### 10.1 Methodology: Observation-Anchored Forecasting

A key methodological contribution of this project is the **Observation-Anchored** approach to life expectancy reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing mortality entirely from Li-Lee latent factors (which introduces a rank-1 approximation bias), we anchor projections to the observed mortality at 2020 and apply only the model-predicted variation:

$$\ln(m_{x,t,i}) = \ln(m_{x,2020,i})^{observed} + B_x \cdot \sum_{\tau=2021}^{t} \Delta K_\tau^{forecast}$$

This approach:
- Eliminates the rank-1 reconstruction bias that would otherwise produce $e_0$ values ~6 years below reality.
- Uses the model only for what it is designed to do: predict *change* in mortality, not reconstruct absolute levels.
- Is conceptually analogous to how actuarial practitioners work: start from the current best estimate and project forward.

The country-specific factors ($k_{t,i}$) are fixed at their 2020 observed values, consistent with the Li-Lee stationarity assumption. This prevents the recursive drift problem observed when projecting specific factors over 30 years.

### 10.2 Dual Uncertainty Framework

Consistent with Project 04, we combine two sources of uncertainty:
- **Model uncertainty (MC Dropout)**: 1,000 stochastic forward passes with Dropout active during inference. Each simulation produces a different trajectory due to the stochastic regularisation.
- **Process uncertainty (Li-Lee calibrated noise)**: Gaussian noise with $\sigma$ calibrated on the full historical series of Li-Lee first differences. Added to each simulation at each time step.

Process noise standard deviations:
- Male $\Delta K_t$: $\sigma = 5.99$
- Female $\Delta K_t$: $\sigma = 9.08$

The higher female process noise reflects the greater historical volatility of female mortality improvements — consistent with the stationarity analysis findings.

### 10.3 Mean-Bias Correction (MBC) as Bayesian Shrinkage

MBC corrects the systematic drift that accumulates in recursive neural forecasts:
$$\hat{\Delta}_t^{MBC} = \hat{\Delta}_t^{LSTM} + \underbrace{(\mu_{Li-Lee} - \mu_{LSTM})}_{\mathcal{B}}$$

Bias vectors found:
- Male: $\mathcal{B}_{K_t} = +0.85$ (model slightly under-predicts mortality improvement)
- Female: $\mathcal{B}_{K_t} = +1.96$ (model significantly under-predicts female improvement)

The larger female bias is consistent with the model's higher RMSE on female data — it is less confident about female mortality dynamics and tends toward conservative (less improvement) predictions.

**Interpretation**: MBC with $Z=1$ (full credibility to the neural signal, anchored to the actuarial prior) produces very conservative projections — almost flat $e_0$ over 30 years. This is because the bias correction effectively neutralises the model's predicted improvement. The unconstrained AINN (without MBC) produces more optimistic and arguably more realistic projections (+1.7 to +2.9 years for males, +2.0 to +4.4 years for females).

**For the paper**: We present both variants (with and without MBC) and note that the "correct" choice depends on the use case. For reserving (conservative), MBC is appropriate. For best-estimate projections, the unconstrained AINN is more informative.

### 10.4 Results: Stochastic Life Expectancy Projections (2020-2050)

#### Switzerland (Case Study)

| Metric | Male | Female |
|:---|:---|:---|
| $e_0$ (2020, observed) | 80.26 | 83.58 |
| $e_0$ (2050, AINN median) | 82.01 | 86.04 |
| $e_0$ (2050, AINN+MBC) | 80.42 | 83.30 |
| 95% CI (2050, AINN) | [78.21, 84.65] | [81.66, 88.31] |
| Net gain (AINN) | +1.74 | +2.46 |

#### Full Cluster Summary (AINN, without MBC)

| Country | Male 2020 | Male 2050 | Gain M | Female 2020 | Female 2050 | Gain F |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Switzerland | 80.26 | 82.01 | +1.74 | 83.58 | 86.04 | +2.46 |
| Sweden | 79.94 | 81.69 | +1.75 | 82.93 | 85.55 | +2.62 |
| Norway | 80.57 | 82.25 | +1.68 | 83.27 | 85.79 | +2.52 |
| West Germany | 78.28 | 80.28 | +2.00 | 82.20 | 85.06 | +2.86 |
| Netherlands | 79.14 | 80.99 | +1.85 | 81.96 | 84.89 | +2.93 |
| Japan | 80.44 | 82.16 | +1.72 | 84.89 | 86.94 | +2.05 |

### 10.5 Discussion of Results

**Biological plausibility**: The projected gains (+1.7 to +2.0 years for males, +2.0 to +2.9 years for females over 30 years) are conservative compared to historical rates of improvement but consistent with the post-2011 deceleration observed in the data. The model has learned the "slowdown" and projects it forward.

**Sex differential**: Female gains are consistently larger than male gains (+0.7 to +1.1 years more). This reflects the model's learning that female mortality has more room for improvement in the current regime — consistent with the steeper female $K_t$ decline observed in the Li-Lee decomposition.

**Convergence**: West Germany shows the largest male gain (+2.00) and Netherlands the largest female gain (+2.93), consistent with the "catch-up" dynamics observed in Project 04. Japan female has the smallest gain (+2.05) because it starts from the highest baseline (84.89) — approaching a biological ceiling.

**MBC effect**: MBC produces almost flat projections (gains of +0.15 to +0.45 years). This is because the bias correction is large relative to the predicted improvement — effectively saying "the model's predicted improvement is mostly drift, not signal." This is overly conservative for a best-estimate projection but appropriate for a prudent reserving assumption.

### 10.6 Comparison with Project 04

| Metric | Project 04 (Total) | Project 05 (Male) | Project 05 (Female) |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| CHE $e_0$ (2020) | 81.71 | 80.26 | 83.58 |
| CHE $e_0$ (2050) | 84.77 | 82.01 | 86.04 |
| CHE gain | +3.06 | +1.74 | +2.46 |
| 95% CI width | ±0.9 yrs | ±6.4 yrs | ±6.7 yrs |

**Key differences**:
1. Project 05 produces more conservative gains (+1.7/+2.5 vs +3.1). This is because the Optuna champion with lb=15 has learned the post-2011 deceleration more deeply (15 years of context vs 10).
2. Project 05 CI are much wider (±6.4 vs ±0.9). This reflects the larger process noise in the sex-specific decomposition and the longer lookback window which amplifies uncertainty over 30 recursive steps.
3. Project 05 provides sex-specific projections — a capability Project 04 does not have.

### 10.7 Technical Note: Recursive Drift in Specific Factors

During development, we attempted to use the projected country-specific factors ($k_{t,i}$) in the back-transformation. This produced biologically absurd results ($e_0$ collapsing to single digits) because the specific factors accumulated systematic drift over 30 recursive steps.

The solution — fixing specific factors at their 2020 values — is consistent with the Li-Lee framework's stationarity assumption and is the standard approach in the literature. The stationarity penalty (excluded from training because it hurt RMSE) would have mitigated this drift but at the cost of one-step-ahead accuracy. This is a genuine trade-off between short-term accuracy and long-term stability that deserves discussion in the paper.

---

## 11. Future Work

### 11.1 Multi-Rank Li-Lee (Rank-2 or Rank-3)
The current rank-1 Li-Lee decomposition captures the dominant mortality trend but leaves a non-trivial residual. A rank-2 or rank-3 decomposition would:
- Reduce the reconstruction bias (currently ~1 year offset from published $e_0$).
- Provide additional features for the LSTM (e.g., 13 features for rank-2: 2 common + 12 specific).
- Potentially capture cohort effects or age-specific dynamics missed by rank-1.

This is planned as a separate experimental branch. If successful, it would require re-running Notebooks 02-04 with the expanded feature set.

### 11.2 Stationarity Penalty for Long-Term Stability
The stationarity penalty was excluded because it hurt one-step-ahead RMSE. However, the recursive drift problem in specific factors suggests it may have value for long-term forecasting stability. A future experiment could:
- Train with stationarity penalty (accepting worse RMSE).
- Project specific factors recursively (instead of fixing at 2020).
- Compare long-term $e_0$ stability with the current approach.

### 11.3 Multi-Step Training
Instead of training the model to predict one step ahead and then using it recursively, train it to predict multiple steps simultaneously. This would directly optimise for the recursive forecasting task and potentially reduce drift accumulation.

### 11.4 True Gompertz Penalty in the Loss Function
The current monotonicity penalty is a temporal surrogate ($\Delta K_t > 0$), not the actual Gompertz constraint ($m_{x+1} \geq m_x$ for all ages). Implementing the true Gompertz penalty requires:
- Differentiable back-transformation from $\Delta K_t$ to $m_x$ within the training loop.
- Using the Li-Lee formula: $\ln(m_x) = a_x + B_x K_t + b_x k_{t,i}$.
- Penalising $\sum_x \max(0, m_x - m_{x+1})^2$ for ages 40-90.

This is computationally expensive (requires storing and differentiating through the full age profile at each training step) but would produce a model with guaranteed Gompertz compliance in the projections — eliminating the data-inherited violations observed in Notebook 05.

**Trade-off**: The Gompertz penalty would likely increase training time significantly and may interact with the coherence/monotonicity penalties in unpredictable ways. The current approach (surrogato + post-hoc audit) is pragmatic and defensible; the true Gompertz is the theoretically correct alternative for future exploration.

### 11.5 Recursive Projection of Specific Factors
Currently, country-specific factors are fixed at their 2020 values for the 30-year projection (Li-Lee stationarity assumption). An alternative:
- Keep the stationarity penalty in training to control drift.
- Project specific factors recursively with the LSTM.
- This would allow the model to capture future country-specific dynamics (e.g., a country accelerating or decelerating relative to the cluster).

The challenge is balancing the stationarity constraint (which hurts one-step RMSE by ~8%) against the forecasting stability it provides.

### 11.6 Sex-Specific Architecture Enhancements
The current binary sex indicator (0/1) is minimal. Alternatives:
- **Learned sex embedding**: a small embedding layer that maps the sex indicator to a higher-dimensional representation, allowing the model to learn more complex sex-specific dynamics.
- **Separate decoder heads**: shared LSTM encoder for temporal patterns, then M/F-specific dense layers for the output. This separates "what patterns exist in time" from "how do these patterns differ by sex."

### 11.7 Fat-Tail Process Noise (Planned: Notebook 07)
Replace the Gaussian process noise with Student-t or bootstrap residuals to capture potential fat-tail events (pandemics, medical breakthroughs). Compare SCR under different distributional assumptions.

## 12. XAI & Validation (Notebook 05)

### 12.1 Temporal Saliency

Gradient-based sensitivity analysis reveals which years in the 15-year input window drive the forecast. Results:
- **Male peak**: t-3 (9.9%) — the model is most sensitive to the observation 3 years prior.
- **Female peak**: t-4 (10.2%) — slightly deeper memory for female dynamics.

**Comparison with Project 04**: Project 04 found a pronounced peak at t-4 (21.7%) with a 10-year window. Our model with lb=15 distributes importance more uniformly (all lags between 3-10%), suggesting that the longer window allows the model to integrate information from the full temporal context rather than concentrating on a single lag.

**Interpretation**: The model does not exhibit "short memory" (relying only on the most recent years) or "concentration" (relying on a single historical event). This is consistent with a well-regularised model that integrates evidence from the entire lookback window.

### 12.2 SHAP Influence Mapping

SHAP (KernelExplainer) decomposes the Swiss male mortality forecast into contributions from each input factor. Ranking:
1. **Netherlands** (0.0632) — highest influence on Swiss mortality forecast.
2. **Japan** (0.0400) — second highest.
3. **Sweden** (0.0382) — third.
4. **Switzerland** (0.0370) — own autoregressive signal, fourth.
5. **Norway** (0.0228) — fifth.
6. **West Germany** (0.0198) — sixth.
7. **Common $K_t$** (0.0068) — lowest among mortality factors.
8. **Sex indicator** (0.0000) — no influence (constant for this sample).

**Comparison with Project 04**: Project 04 found Norway as the top predictor, followed by Switzerland. Our model finds Netherlands as top predictor. This difference is attributable to:
- Different architecture (48-32 vs 32-16) and lookback (15 vs 10) — the model "sees" different patterns.
- Sex-specific decomposition — the male-specific dynamics may be more influenced by Dutch mortality patterns (Netherlands has historically strong pension/longevity data).
- SHAP with KernelExplainer on a single sample is inherently noisy — the ranking may vary with the reference point.

**Key observation**: The Common Factor $K_t$ has the lowest SHAP value among mortality factors. This is counter-intuitive — $K_t$ is supposed to be the dominant driver. The explanation: SHAP measures marginal contribution *relative to the background*. Since all samples in the background share a similar $K_t$ pattern, its marginal contribution is low. The country-specific factors vary more across samples, giving them higher marginal SHAP values.

### 12.3 Biological Consistency — Gompertz Monotonicity

**Formal test** (ages 40-90, projected 2050): Small violations detected (1-8 per country), but all with maximum violation < 0.001 (marginal noise) except Norway Female (max 0.0014, CONDITIONAL).

**Diagnostic**: The violations at identical ages exist in the 2020 observed HMD data — confirming they are inherited from the data source, not generated by the model. The observation-anchored approach preserves data-level irregularities.

**Substantive verdict**: **STRUCTURALLY GOMPERTZ-COMPLIANT.** The model applies a uniform age-sensitivity shift ($B_x \cdot \Delta K_t$) which mathematically cannot introduce new monotonicity violations — it can only preserve existing ones from the data.

### 12.4 Rolling-Window Validation

| Window | RMSE | Train | Val |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1956-2005 / 2006-2014 | 6.2351 | 70 | 18 |
| 1956-2008 / 2009-2017 | 6.8442 | 76 | 18 |
| 1956-2011 / 2012-2020 | 6.1725 | 80 | 18 |

- **Mean**: 6.4173
- **Std**: 0.3711
- **CV**: 5.78%
- **Verdict**: PASS (threshold: CV < 20%)

**Interpretation**: The model performs consistently across different historical periods. The middle window (2009-2017) is slightly harder (RMSE 6.84) — this period includes the post-2011 deceleration as the primary validation signal, which is the most challenging regime shift to predict. The current standard split (2012-2020) includes the 2020 COVID shock, which paradoxically makes it "easier" because the model's conservative bias aligns with the temporary mortality spike.

**Female:**
| Country | Median $e_0$ (2050) | SCR (VaR 99.5%) | SCR (ES 99.0%) |

| Switzerland | 86.04 | +2.877 | +2.919 |

| Netherlands | 84.89 | +3.579 | +3.632 |
| Japan | 86.94 | +2.322 | +2.355 |

**Key observations:**
1. **Male SCR > Female SCR** across all countries. Male mortality is more uncertain at the 30-year horizon, consistent with the higher historical volatility of male-specific factors.
2. **West Germany has the highest SCR** for both sexes (+4.47 M, +3.53 F). The "catch-up" dynamics make German mortality the hardest to predict — faster improvement in the median but wider uncertainty bands.
3. **Japan Female has the lowest SCR** (+2.36). As the global longevity leader, Japan Female is closest to the biological ceiling, with less room for surprise longevity gains.
4. **VaR and ES are close** (gap < 0.2 years for all countries). This indicates well-behaved tail distributions without fat tails or explosive scenarios.

**Comparison with Project 04**: Project 04 reported SCR(ES) = +1.153 years for Switzerland (Total). Our sex-specific results are much higher (+3.76 M, +2.92 F). The difference is driven by:
- Wider confidence intervals in the sex-specific model (±6 years vs ±0.9 years in P04).
- The larger process noise for sex-specific Li-Lee decomposition.
- The 30-year recursive forecast accumulating more uncertainty with lb=15 vs lb=10.

### 13.2 Reverse Stress Test (FINMA Methodology)

**Switzerland summary:**
- Male: δ* = **45.3%** (a permanent 45.3% reduction in mortality rates would exhaust the ES 99% buffer).
- Female: δ* = **48.5%**.
- Linearity verified: R² > 0.999 for all countries.
- A standard 10% shock consumes 20-22% of the SCR buffer.

**Comparison with Project 04**: P04 found δ* = 23.3% for Switzerland (Total). Our higher δ* (45%) means the buffer is proportionally harder to exhaust — consistent with the larger SCR (+3.76 vs +1.15). The ratio δ*/SCR is similar in both projects, confirming the linear relationship between shock magnitude and $e_0$ impact.

### 13.3 Model-Based Stress Test

A negative shock of -2.0 (in standardised $\Delta K_t$ space, approximately 2 standard deviations of mortality improvement) was injected at forecast year 2026 and the model's recursive response observed.

**Results:**
- Immediate effect at 2026: -1.886 (94% of injected shock transmitted).
- Effect at 2035 (9 years after shock): -1.446 (slight dampening).
- Effect at 2050 (24 years after shock): -1.559 (stable, no further amplification).
- **Maximum amplification ratio: 1.02× — STABLE.**

**Interpretation**: The model absorbs the shock without amplification. The slight dampening (~75% of the original magnitude persists at 2050) is expected — as the shock exits the 15-year sliding window, its direct influence fades, but the cumulative effect remains because levels are computed by integration. The model does not exhibit explosive feedback loops.

**Regulatory value**: This demonstrates that the AINN is numerically stable under perturbation — a key requirement for FINMA internal model validation. No explosive amplification means the model can be safely used for scenario analysis without producing unrealistic cascading effects.

## 14. Pipeline Refinement: Process Noise Calibration & Ensemble

### 14.1 The Double-Counting Problem

During post-completion review, we identified that the process noise σ in the dual uncertainty framework was calibrated on the **full historical variability** of Li-Lee first differences. This includes variability that the LSTM has already learned to predict — resulting in double-counting.

The historical σ (Kt, Male: 5.99, Female: 9.08) was replaced with the **residual σ** from walk-forward one-step-ahead predictions (Kt, Male: 2.80, Female: 3.64). This represents a **53-60% reduction**, confirming that the LSTM captures roughly half of the historical mortality variability.

**Impact**: 95% CI width reduced by ~55% across all countries. SCR estimates dropped from +3.76 to +1.73 years (CHE Male, ES 99.0%). Medians remained unchanged — the problem was entirely in the noise calibration, not in the model.

### 14.2 5-Seed Ensemble (Model Averaging)

To address the borderline multi-seed CV (8.90%), we adopted a model averaging approach: 5 models trained with different seeds (42, 123, 256, 512, 1024) are averaged in scaled space before inverse transform and noise addition. This is equivalent to credibility pooling across model initialisations.

The ensemble uses 200 MC Dropout simulations per model × 5 models = 1,000 total trajectories, matching the sample size of single-seed runs.

**Impact**: Further ~10% CI reduction on top of σ correction. The combined effect (σ recalibration + ensemble) produces CI of ±1.7-2.2 years and SCR in the +1.3-2.6 year range — consistent with the sex-specific decomposition of P04's Total results.

### 14.3 Notebook Restructuring

The improvements were initially developed in exploratory notebooks (NB07: σ recalibration, NB08: ensemble). These were subsequently absorbed into the main pipeline:
- **NB03**: now includes 5-seed ensemble training with model persistence (previously: disposable multi-seed test).
- **NB04**: now includes walk-forward residual calibration, ensemble MC Dropout forecast, and corrected process noise (previously: single-seed with historical σ).
- **NB05-06**: unchanged in logic, now consume the ensemble-corrected results.

The pipeline is now 6 notebooks (01-06), linear and self-contained.
